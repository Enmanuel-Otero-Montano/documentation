Mobile view customization
=========================

To tailor the mobile view of your website, you can edit the :ref:`Cols <responsiveness/cols>` and
:ref:`Visibility <responsiveness/visibility>` features without any impact on the desktop view. To do
so, open the website editor, click the mobile icon at the top, select an element of your building
block, and go to the :guilabel:`Customize` tab.

Cols
----

The :guilabel:`Cols` layout allows you to determine the number of elements visible per line within
the block. By default, on mobile devices, one element is visible to ensure that content remains
easily readable and accessible on smaller screens. You can adjust this value from the
:guilabel:`Mobile Preview` mode by clicking the block you want to modify, selecting the
:guilabel:`Cols` :guilabel:`Layout`, and adjusting the number.
